RPi (Raspberry pi) controls the video camera for catching it for turning on a relay for door unlocking. The module contains a secured face recognizer for automatic door unlocking. The camera catches the facial picture and compares it with the image which is stored in the database .If the picture is found in the database then the door lock opens otherwise it will produce a Mobile notification that an unknown person is trying to gain access."</string>
